			<h3>Enigma</h3>
	        	This is an event usually conducted during the even semesters, this event include various online coding competition
                        with some cool fun events.  </center>

			<h3>C/C++ Letures and Tutorials</h3>
	      C/C++ are very important old flexible and easy to learn programming laguages.Is taught to everyone who is interested 
             through lectures,Video tutorials,Power Point presentation. <br>
               </center><b>C/C++ Overview</b><br><center>
                 1.C is a general-purpose programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs.
                   C has facilities for structured programming and allows lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system
                   prevents many unintended operations. In C, all executable code is contained within subroutines, which are called "functions"<br>
                 2.C++ is a general purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while 
                     also providing the facilities for low level memory manipulation.It is designed with a bias for systems programming with
                     performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design requirements. C++ has also been found useful in many other
                     contexts, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, SQL), performance critical applications 
                      (e.g. telephone switches, space probes) and entertainment software, such as video games.

			<h3>Codemons</h3>
	                 Campus Chapter of "Codechef for NITH",Codemons is a part of the CSEC where the needs for competitive programming are catered
                         and nourished.A group of enthusiastic people gather around discuss various algorithms and stuff needed to have a solid base.

			<h3>Web Development</h3>
	        	CSEC also aims to provide students a introduction to the tools that can possibly help the students of NITH to make  
                        contribution in the field of web.Workshops for HTML,CSS and PHP are taken up so that they can gain knowledge of these 
                        tools.Apart from these languages various other aspects required during web devlopment are also introduced.

			<h3>Python</h3>

                         Python is a short, simple, elegant and yet very powerful programming language.Lectures are conducted
                         that demonstrate about the basic python and its scope initially and later deeper diving is done in python. <br>
                         </center><b>More on Python:<br></b>
                         <center>
                         Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability,
                         and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as 
                         C++ or Java.The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.Python
                         supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural
                         styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard 
                         library.Python interpreters are available for installation on many operating systems, allowing Python code execution on a
                         majority of systems.
